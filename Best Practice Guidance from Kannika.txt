Best Practice Guidance from Kannika

Always aim to back up the __consumer_offsets topic whenever possible—it’s your best shot at preserving consumer state.

When direct backup of __consumer_offsets is not feasible (e.g., in managed Kafka services with restricted access), plan for alternative offset-handling strategies like the header-based or timestamp-based methods mentioned above.

Document your recovery procedures clearly, including how to reestablish consumer state after a restoration, and test them regularly to ensure effectiveness.
